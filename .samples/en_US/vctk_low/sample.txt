A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multi-colored circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.
